## Project Summary

Kosmos is a website intended to display predictive information on every country in the world. Using historical data on these countries, we want the public to be able to see where different areas of our globe are heading in terms of their population, military size, and various other fields. Users of the site will have the ability to click on a country (from a spinning globe) and select a year within a range (now to 2075) and see all of the predictions our backend makes through mathematical equations on the different fields. With these fields, users can also see visualizations to detail expected changes across the years.
